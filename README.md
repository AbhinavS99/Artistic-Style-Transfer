# Artistic-Style-Transfer
The project is an implementation of the [Neural Style Transfer Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.

## Working
The style transfer works by defining two types of losses viz. style loss (for the style portion of the image) and content loss(for content portion of image). The two losses measure the distance of the respective parameters from their source images and the objective of the algorithm is to minimize both so that the final output image can have the content form the content image and the style from the style image.
